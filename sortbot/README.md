# sortbot

VLM-driven pick-and-place on an SO101 arm: tidy the things on the table into groups.
Your spoken task and RULES say what goes where; with no task it groups similar items
sensibly. The VLM chooses pick and place coordinates from the camera views.

```

**Hearing you.** With the Listening toggle on, the mic streams to ElevenLabs realtime STT over a
WebSocket (`scribe_v2_realtime`). Interim transcripts arrive while you are still talking, and the finished
sentence is endpointed by VAD ~0.6 s after you stop. If the socket cannot be opened (no key, no network,
an API error, an older SDK), STT falls back to the chunked path. `GET /state` `voice.stt_mode` reports
which one is live (`stream` / `chunk`), and the Listening button shows it. The mic starts when you turn
Listening on. **Interim transcripts feed the urgent pre-filter**: "stop" / "wait" fires the Control events
the moment the word is recognised — measured firing *127 ms before the speaker finished the sentence* —
while only the endpointed sentence reaches `q_heard`. Push-to-talk is available as well; an identical
utterance arriving from both paths within 2.5 s is dropped as a double delivery.

**Two threads, four queues.** The action loop (perception -> one planner call -> one tool) is too slow
to hold a conversation, so talking and acting are split. `q_heard` (everything you say) is drained by the
**`luna-chat`** thread, which answers in one fast call (`vlm.chat_model`) within a second or so and pushes the
spoken reply to `q_say` and any instructions it distilled to `q_directives`. The action loop drains
`q_directives` at its existing drain point. Stop/pause-shaped speech is caught by a **regex pre-filter
before any model call**. The chat worker reads cached state and the latest cached camera JPEGs. Full
contract: the MULTI-QUEUE block at the top of `main.py`.

Loop: `home()` -> capture overhead + wrist -> composite the cached cm-grid overlay -> VLM reads the photos
and emits one coordinate-based tool call (`pick_at(x_cm,y_cm)`, `place_at(x_cm,y_cm)`, `say(text)`, `done`;
wrist angle `turn_to(deg)` absolute / `turn_by(deg)` relative; low-level `move_to/open_gripper/close_gripper`
for recovery) -> validate against the workspace envelope (rejections go back to the VLM as FAILED tool
results) -> execute -> repeat. Voice corrections drain at the top of each iteration into a persistent RULES
list sent with every prompt.

**Units**: the VLM-facing surface (tool args, overlay grid labels, prompt state, history) is centimeters;
everything internal (robot, config.yaml, calib.json, safety envelope) stays millimeters. The cm->mm
conversion happens in exactly one place (`main._mm_args`; `vlm._state_text` + the overlay labels are the
mm->cm half).

**Grasping**: `pick_at` descends with the jaws open, then `Loop.verify_alignment` takes both camera views
and makes one structured call on the fast `vlm.verify_model` -> `{aligned, dx_cm, dy_cm, reason, confidence}`.
If not aligned (or aligned below `grasp.min_confidence`), a correction clamped to `grasp.max_correction_cm`
goes through the safety envelope, then another check, up to `grasp.max_retries` more times. If still not
aligned, the arm retreats with the jaws open and the planner gets
`FAILED: alignment not confirmed after N tries: <reason>` to re-plan from. The low-level `close_gripper`
tool goes through the same check. Every verdict, with a side-by-side overhead|wrist thumbnail, lands in
the decision log; the last one shows in the Operate tab.

**Threading**: exactly one thread may touch the Feetech serial bus at a time — every bus access goes
through `Session.robot_lock`, and components that cannot get the lock serve cached state (see the invariant
at the top of `main.py`; `SORTBOT_BUS_ASSERT=1` arms a proxy that fails on unlocked bus calls).

## Frames

* **Table frame**: mm, origin = robot base projected onto tabletop, x forward, y left, z up, table z=0.
* **Base frame** (FK/IK): meters, `base_link` of the URDF. `table_T_base` (rigid, from calibration) converts.
* End effector points straight down; only `wrist_roll` changes -- `turn_to(deg)` sets it absolutely,
  `turn_by(deg)` nudges it relatively (both clamp to -90..90). Use them to square the jaws up with a long
  or narrow object before picking it.
* Joint order: shoulder_pan, shoulder_lift, elbow_flex, wrist_flex, wrist_roll, gripper.

## Running

```
./run.sh -m sortbot.main                                     # HUD on :8765; connect robot/cams/vlm in Setup, then Start

./run.sh -m sortbot.tests.test_e2e                           # e2e test, doubles injected into the Loop (HUD on a random port)
./run.sh -m sortbot.tests.test_hud_actions                   # HTTP tests for every /action endpoint (injected doubles, random port)
./run.sh -m sortbot.calibrate                                # hardware: teleoperated target calibration -> calib/calib.json (see below)
./run.sh -m sortbot.calibrate --mode aruco                   # ArUco mat + Kabsch rigid transform

```

`main` flags: `--max-steps N` (default 40), `--hud-port P`, `--no-voice`, `--rules-file PATH` (default
`sortbot/calib/rules.json`, persistent across runs; delete it to forget rules), `--config PATH`. Tests
inject doubles from `sortbot/testing.py` through `Session(factories=...)`.

## HUD (browser page)

Sticky header with connection dots (robot / cams / vlm), a status banner ("Not connected -- connect the
devices in Setup", "Sorting -- step 7/30 ..."; clicking it jumps to the relevant tab), a pulsing red
**MIC LIVE** chip whenever the microphone is listening, and the red **E-STOP** (always visible, key `e`).
Below: the overhead stream as the hero (~65% width) with the wrist cam as a picture-in-picture -- **drag
it anywhere on the stream, cycle its size (18/26/38%) with the arrows button, or hide it with x / the `w`
key** (a small "wrist" button brings it back; position, size and hidden state are remembered per browser)
-- and four intent tabs on the right:

* **SETUP** -- one Connect/Disconnect row per device (Robot / Cameras / Vision model, with live status and
  connect errors), then the calibration flow with a numbered, state-driven how-to (current step
  highlighted, live residuals, collinear-samples warning, when-to-recalibrate note).
* **OPERATE** -- task text, Start/Pause/Resume/Stop (+ Step once / max steps), corrections (text box,
  push-to-talk, and the **Listening** toggle mapped to `mic_on`/`mic_off`; off at start), and the rules
  editor.
* **TUNE** -- model dropdowns (planner / chat / grasp-check / TTS / STT / voice) and the **grasp depth** trim.
* **DEBUG** -- manual arm control (home / gripper / jog pad / go-to / torque), the decision log, and a raw
  list of every registered action.

A dismissible 3-step first-run checklist (1 Connect devices -> 2 Calibrate -> 3 Start sorting, current step
highlighted, steps link to their tabs) sits under the header and disappears once a run starts. Disabled
controls say why in one line ("needs a robot connected -- connect it in Setup"). The "?" button in the tab
bar reveals every control's one-line `help` text (all registered actions carry `help=`, also served as
title tooltips). Buttons show a pending spinner then a tick / inline error; the bot's say() lines and
safety rejections pop up as toasts. **Demo** (header button) is a fullscreen judging view -- stream +
status + last decision + rules ticker (Esc exits). Keys: `e` = E-STOP, `p` = pause/resume, `w` =
hide/show the wrist PiP, `space` = capture while calibrating. Groups come dynamically from `GET /actions`:
known groups map onto the four tabs, and any new group/action renders as generic button rows (unknown
groups land in Debug). `GET /state` `perception.calibrated` reports whether a px->mm homography exists
for the current cams (fitted H in calib.json) -- it drives the "Not calibrated" banner and checklist
step 2. While no run is active a preview thread keeps the camera streams live.

Devices (`connect_robot` / `connect_cameras` / `connect_vlm`, RUN group; `connect=false` disconnects;
connect errors are reported in the response):

* robot: the SO101 follower arm
* cams: overhead + wrist OpenCV cameras, opened directly (not through the follower)
* vlm: the OpenAI planner (fails with a clear message if `OPENAI_API_KEY` is missing)

Any combination works, e.g. cameras without a robot for a live preview. Device changes are refused while
a run is active (Stop first) and while a calibration session is active (Finish/Cancel first) --
disconnecting the robot mid-calibration would orphan the teleop thread against a discarded robot.

RUN group: `start` / `pause` / `resume` / `stop` / `step_once` (from idle: starts paused and runs exactly one
step) / `set_max_steps(n)` / `set_task(text)` (free-text goal, e.g. "sort it however makes sense" -- prepended
to the VLM prompt as `GOAL: ...`). Runs are restartable from the page without restarting the process.
`GET /state` carries `run: {phase, step, max_steps, task, last_error, result, connected: {robot, cams, vlm}}`.

ROBOT group (all through the normal safety envelope; refused while the loop is running -- pause first):
`home`, `open_gripper`, `close_gripper`, `jog(axis: x|y|z|roll, delta)` (mm, or degrees for roll),
`goto(x, y, z)`, `set_wrist(deg)` (absolute wrist angle, -90..90; 0 = jaws square to the table x axis) and
`adjust_wrist(delta)` (turn BY delta degrees from where it is now) -- both also on the Debug tab with
±5/±15° nudges and a live readout, `set_z_trim(mm)` (grasp depth, see below), `torque_on`, and `torque_off` = **E-STOP** (always visible in the header):
`bus.disable_torque()` plus a flag; every motion raises/returns a torque error until
`torque_on`, and the loop is paused. `GET /state` carries `robot: {ee_pose, joints_deg, gripper_open, holding,
torque, z_trim_mm, grasp_z_cm}`.

### Grasp depth (the gripper stops short of the table / presses into it)

`workspace.z_trim_mm` (default 0, range ±150 mm) shifts the plane the arm works to. **Negative lowers it.**
If picks close on air just above the object, the assumed table plane is too high -- trim down; if the arm
leans on the table, trim up. One number moves the commanded grasp z, the pre-place z and the safety
envelope's z floor together (`robot.grasp_z_mm` is the single source). `workspace.z_floor_mm` (default
-150 mm) is the absolute backstop against a typo -- lower it if your table really is deeper. Live from
the HUD **Tune > Grasp depth**: a typed field plus -10/-2/+2/+10 mm nudges, the resulting grasp height in
cm, and an amber warning past ±40 mm (large trims are allowed, but check the arm clears the table first).
`set_z_trim` persists to `config.yaml`, so it survives a restart. A deep trim makes every grasp further
from HOME: if moves start coming back as "step of N mm exceeds max_step" the message says how much of
that the trim added -- reduce the trim or raise `workspace.max_step_mm`.

VOICE group: `say_to_bot(text)` (alias `say_to_robot`) sends a typed correction through the voice classifier --
rule-shaped sentences are persisted to RULES immediately (or by the loop while running), short bare commands
(`open`, `home`, `stop`, ...) execute at the next step, anything else becomes a one-shot `(human)` hint for the
VLM. **Push-to-talk**: hold the mic button; the page records with MediaRecorder (webm/opus) and POSTs the clip to
`transcribe(audio_b64, mime)`, which runs ElevenLabs STT (`voice.stt_model`, default `scribe_v2`) and feeds the
transcript through `say_to_bot`; the transcript is shown on the page and in `/state` (`voice.last_transcript`).
A note appears if the browser has no microphone access. `speak(text)` is a TTS test (plays on the server machine).
`GET /state` carries `voice: {mode, queue, last_transcript, tts_model, stt_model, voice_id}`.

RULES group: `add_rule(text)`, `delete_rule(i)`, `move_rule(i, dir: up|down)` and `clear_hints()` manage the
persistent RULES list (same RulesStore the voice path uses; survives restarts via `--rules-file`) and the
one-shot hints of the current run. The rules tab renders the list with per-rule up/down/delete controls;
`GET /state` carries `rules: {list, hints}`.

PERCEPTION group: `px_to_mm(u, v)` converts an overhead pixel to table-frame mm via the current homography
(click the overhead image to read a position off it). `GET /state` carries `perception: {calibrated}`.

LOG group: a ring buffer of the last 200 decisions/events -- every loop tool call (with a 160px overlay jpeg
thumbnail at decision time, latency and the say text), plus voice events, mode changes and
torque on/off -- served newest-first at `GET /log` as
`{i, step, t, tool, args, result, ok, say, latency_ms, thumb_b64}`. The log tab renders a scrolling list with
thumbnails; rejections / safety errors / E-STOP (`ok: false`, `FAILED:`/`rejected:`/`safety:` results) are red.
`log_clear()` empties it.

CHAT group (VOICE actions): everything you say reaches `q_heard`; the `luna-chat` worker answers it.
`GET /state` carries `chat: {transcript, thinking, alive, replies, model, last_latency_ms, directives}`
(the Operate transcript panel) and `voice.queue` shows both the undrained utterances and the directives
already distilled for the loop. `clear_chat()` empties the transcript. `GET /state` `grasp:
{verify, max_correction_cm, max_retries, min_confidence, verify_model, z_trim_mm, grasp_z_cm, large_trim,
last: {aligned, accepted, dx_cm, dy_cm, reason, confidence, try, tries, x_cm, y_cm}}`.

MODELS group: `get_models()` lists what is selectable -- OpenAI vision-capable ids from `models.list()`
(gpt-5 / gpt-4.1 / gpt-4o / o3 / o4 families, cached 5 min, graceful when the key is missing) and the
ElevenLabs TTS/STT model ids plus the first ~30 voices from `voices.search()`. `set_model(provider, value)`
with `provider: openai|openai_chat|openai_verify|elevenlabs_tts|elevenlabs_stt|elevenlabs_voice` hot-swaps the
live VLM/VoiceIO **and** persists to `config.yaml` (`vlm.model`, `vlm.chat_model`, `vlm.verify_model`,
`voice.tts_model`, `voice.stt_model`, `voice.elevenlabs_voice_id`)
via a minimal text edit that preserves comments. The models tab shows one dropdown per provider; beside the
OpenAI one the last VLM call's latency and a rough per-call $ estimate (from token usage and a small built-in
price table) are shown, also served as `/state` `vlm: {model, last_latency_ms, last_cost_usd, last_usage}`.

Grasp config (`config.yaml`): `grasp: {verify: true, max_correction_cm: 2.0, max_retries: 2,
min_confidence: 0.5}`. Default `true`. `verify: false` logs a warning at startup and shows the check as
OFF in the HUD.

Loop behaviour: every iteration starts with `home()`. Where the arm may go is bounded by
`workspace.aabb_mm` (x 120-420 mm, |y| <= 220 mm) and the IK reachability check; `workspace.max_step_mm`
(600 mm) is a runaway backstop on one commanded XY translation, wider than the workspace diagonal
(~533 mm). It measures the **XY translation** only -- `move_to` lifts, crosses and descends. Rejected
or unsafe commands are returned to the VLM as `FAILED: ...` history entries. Voice input: "rule"-shaped
sentences are persisted to RULES, `stop` ends the run, `open`/`close`/`home` execute directly, anything
else is passed to the VLM as a `(human) ...` hint. What counts as "already sorted" is the VLM's call:
the prompt tells it to leave things that are already where they belong.

## Calibration (teleop / ball mode)

Put the calibration target (the green ball; or anything with a distinct colour) in the follower's gripper, then
`./run.sh -m sortbot.calibrate` (leader + follower + overhead cam; HUD on :8765) or press **Start calibration** in
the HUD of a running `main` with the robot connected. A background thread teleoperates the follower from the leader arm (config
`leader:`); the sorting loop pauses at its next step boundary. Then:

1. **Pick the target colour** (optional): click the target in the HUD overhead image. The server samples a tolerant
   HSV window (`ColorTarget.from_sample`, hue wraps for reds), runs the detector and draws the detection circle; a click that
   sampled a gray/brown surface or detects an implausibly large blob is rejected and the previous target kept.
   Presets: `--target green|orange|hsv:lo_h,lo_s,lo_v,hi_h,hi_s,hi_v` or `--sample U V`; default from
   `config.yaml calibration.target`. Among same-coloured blobs the roundest large one wins.
2. **Touch table** (once): rest the fingertip on the table and press *Touch table* / `t`. FK z there is the table
   plane -> `base_z_offset_mm` (the only non-identity part of `table_T_base`). Skipped = 0 (or the previous value).
3. **Capture** (`space`) at **8 or more** well-spread positions (>= 15 mm apart, `min_sample_spacing_mm`),
   with the target **resting on the table**, the **gripper pointing straight down**, and the arm **let go of
   and settled** — a capture taken while the arm is still drifting is rejected (the frame and the FK reading
   would describe different poses). A homography has **8 degrees of freedom**, so 8+ points over-determine
   the fit. Each sample pairs the target's pixel centroid with the FK base xyz; after 4 the homography
   refits on every capture and the live view shows numbered sample dots, the sample hull, a **coverage %**,
   the height/tilt spread, and the **fitted cm grid** so you can see the projection against the real table.
   Samples RANSAC excluded from the fit are ringed in red with their error — ***Drop worst sample***
   removes the worst one and refits; *Undo* (`u`) drops the last.
4. **Set table height** (`t`) — **optional**. It measures only the table height (how deep the gripper may go
   to grasp), by resting the fingertip on the tabletop. The captures give the x/y mapping; if you captured
   them with the target on the table, Finish reads the height straight off them, so you can skip this step.
5. **Finish** (`enter`): RANSAC fit `H_px_to_mm`, per-point residual table, written to `calib/calib.json`
   together with `plane_z_mm`, `target`, `method: "teleop"`, `points`, `residuals_mm`, `frame_wh` and
   `saved_at`; the previous file is kept as `calib.json.bak`. Finish **refuses a fit it can tell is bad** and
   says which of these is wrong — too few usable points for 8 DOF, < 10% coverage, near-collinear samples,
   varying target height, varying gripper tilt, or samples excluded by RANSAC — press Finish again (or pass
   `force`) to save anyway. *Cancel* (`q`) writes nothing. The leader is released and the loop resumes with
   the reloaded homography.

**Fit model**: below 8 usable points the fit is a **6-DOF affine**; with 8+ points the full homography is
used. Affine is over-determined from 4 points and cannot invent perspective, which suits a near-nadir
overhead camera. `GET /state calibration.model` reports which.

**Tool point**: every xyz in the app — FK, IK, the safety envelope and the calibration pairing — refers to the
grasp point between the jaws, i.e. the URDF `gripper_frame_link` plus `workspace.tool_offset_mm`. That dummy
frame sits ~7.8 mm off the jaw centreline and ~3.7 mm behind the fingertips; the offset rotates with
`shoulder_pan` / `wrist_roll`, so it lands in a different table direction at every arm pose. Set it to
`[0, 0, 0]` for the raw URDF frame (and recalibrate).

The calibration **persists**: it is written only on Finish, auto-loads on startup (a summary line —
points / residuals / coverage / age — is logged and shown in the Setup tab), and nothing else ever
overwrites it. The overlay is a **cached static layer**: the grid, its cm tick labels, the axis arrows and the
calibration anchors are functions of the calibration and the config, so they are rendered once and
composited onto every frame. The overlay updates when the homography, frame size, grid spacing or anchors
change. It draws the grid, axis arrows, calibration anchors, and the live end-effector cross. Grid spacing,
colours, and RULES are given to the VLM as **text** (an `OVERLAY KEY:` line plus the `RULES:` block in
`vlm._state_text`). At runtime the calibration's own anchor points are drawn on the overlay (small diamonds,
`c1`, `c2`, ...) next to the sampled-area outline -- the grid is pinned at those anchors and interpolated
everywhere else, so a visible mismatch tells you immediately whether the fit is bad or you are simply far
from any anchor. Coordinates outside the sampled area (+20% margin) are refused ("outside the calibrated
area — recalibrate with wider coverage").

After that the **table frame is the base frame** in xy (x fwd, y left, mm). `H` is exact for object centroids at
`plane_z_mm`; taller objects project slightly outward from the camera nadir, lower ones inward (a few mm at most).
`calibration.mode` in config: `ball` = always the fitted H, `aruco` = tags only, `auto` (default) = fitted H, with the
4 ArUco tags overriding per frame when all are visible.

**Recalibrate** whenever the overhead camera or the robot base is moved/bumped, the camera resolution changes, or
the HUD overlay grid stops lining up with the table. Older `calib.json` files still load (rigid `table_T_base`
only).

Model config (`config.yaml`): `vlm.model` is the planner; `vlm.chat_model` (default `gpt-5.4-mini`) is
Luna's conversational voice and `vlm.verify_model` (default the same) the pre-grasp checker -- both are on a
human-visible latency path, so they run a small fast model at `vlm.chat_effort: low` with a short max output
and images downscaled to 512 px. All three are swappable from the HUD Tune tab.

Keys: `OPENAI_API_KEY` (and optional `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`) in `.env` at repo root. Without the ElevenLabs key,
push-to-talk/`speak` report the missing key in their response.
